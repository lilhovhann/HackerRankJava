Two strings,  and , are called anagrams if they contain all the same characters in the same frequencies. For example, the anagrams of CAT are CAT, ACT, TAC, TCA, ATC, and CTA.

Complete the function in the editor. If  and  are case-insensitive anagrams, print "Anagrams"; otherwise, print "Not Anagrams" instead.
